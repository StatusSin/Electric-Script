        <h3>Jurgis Stepenka</h3>
        <p>Jurgis is an international student from Venezuela at Loyola Marymount University, he is a Computer Science 
            major with a minor in Statistics and Data Science. After graduating he plans to get involved with game 
            design, as video games and entertainment bring people together. He hopes to potentially broaden his 
            horizons outside the United States and continue to see more the world.</p>

        <h3>Kevin Gager</h3>
        <p>Kevin is an Electrical Engineering and Computer Science double major at Loyola Marymount University. 
            Upon graduation, he plans on joining Northrop Grumman on their spacecraft design team in their Redondo
            Beach location as well as pursue a Masters in Computer Engineering. He got the idea for this language 
            after seeing his fellow Electrical Engineering students struggling to connect with CS terminology.

        <h3>Aryaman Ramchandran<h3>
        <p>Aryaman is a Computer Science major at Loyola Marymount University. His goals beyond education are to
            become a game designer and found his own indie game company. He also hopes to use computer science and AI
            to create engines that could assist game designers that do not have the techinchal background but still
            have ideas that could benefit the game-space. One such engine in development is a 'chat-GPT' type engine 
            that will one day allow users to ask it to freely generate objects for whatever game-dev language they use
            to allow for all persons to create their own 3D library for their games.
